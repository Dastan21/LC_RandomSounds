# RandomSounds

Lethal Company mod that lets you add custom sounds to the game.
All of the sounds of a specific audio are played synchronously between the players (if they have the mod too and the same custom audios).

## Install

- Install with a Mod Manager

OR

1. Make sure you have [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) & [LCSoundTool](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/no00ob/LCSoundTool/) installed.
2. Move `RandomSounds.dll` and `RandomSounds` into `...\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins`.

## Add sounds

You must create a folder named after the audio you want to add sounds to.
Then add your .wav files in the folder.

Example: `...\plugins\RandomSounds\ClownHorn1\Clown.wav`

## Tip
You can use [LCSoundTool](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/no00ob/LCSoundTool/) and its F5 logging feature to identify the name of the prop audio you want to replace.
